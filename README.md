# Assignment 2 - Tiny CSS game

## What the project does?
### Maze game
The project consists of a maze game where a character controlled by a mouse cursor must try to find their way through the maze and to the goal in the center.
If the player touches any of the walls or gets run over by an enemy ghost, then the player is forced to start over. By reaching the center, you win the game. 

## Why the project is useful?
The project is useful to us students as we learn creative ways of utilizing CSS and its great capabilities. That allows us to expand our knowledge within the field. This assignment also makes us more familiar with structuring a project for this purpose. 
The game is useful for users too because it can help improve their concentration, problem solving skills, and reaction time. Additionally, it can be a fun and entertaining way to spend leisure time.
